# CUDA
cuda codes

compile a cuda file:

nvcc -o a.out example.cu

./a.out

in cmd, a.out



# Simulation of Phase Transition,

main file: kernel.cu

For functions of situations with different temperature t, calculate the max amplitude and phase of each temperature t.
This is the point when phase transition happens.
 

# The result is :
When temperature changes from t = 0.0 to t=10 with an increasement of dt = 0.1,

amp2_movie_f.m4v shows the process of amplitude change 

phase_movie_f.m4v shows the process of phase transition
