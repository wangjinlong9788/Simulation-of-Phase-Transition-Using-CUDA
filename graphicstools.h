/* PXM files
 - supports alpha channel, or CMYK etc. (number of components/channels is variable)
 - supports 16 & 32 colors components (i.e. up to 128bit color per pixel: RGBA) [16&32 bit needs endian info for binary format]
 - full 3D images: height, width and depths (can be used to store movies if interpreted as sequence of frames, use keyword framerate)
 - can encode also P1 through P6 formats
 - 
 
Format:

--------------
P0
SIZE <width> <height> [<depth>]
CH <number of channels>
BITS <1,8,16, or 32>
[MAX <max gray value>] //only for gray images
DATA <A or B>
[ENDIAN <B or L>] //for binary, bits=16 or 32
[MODEL <RGB, GRAY, BW, RGBA, CMYL, HSV, ...>]
[FRAMERATE <rate, float number as frames per second>]
[USER_DEFINED_PARAMETERS]
ENDHDR
<data>
---------------
The whitespace charaters after P0 determine the end of line encoding: UNIX, DOS, MAC (LF,CR+LF, CR).
After "ENDHDR" one EOL marker is expected before the (binary) data starts
"DATA A" is for ASCII, "DATA B" for binary
There should be not data after the <data> part
The header info order (lines between "P0" and "ENDHDR") is arbitrary, but SIZE, CH, BITS, and DATA (and the keyword "ENDHDR") are required
